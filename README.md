# Microsoft Family Safety Bypasser!!
### It's **YOUR** PC!
You should be able to have control of your PC, so I made this GUI tool written in C# to bypass family safety!

GUI is self-explanitory...

Go to the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/Jaylink5353/skills-communicate-using-markdown/releases) to get a prebuilt exe.

REQUIRES Admin Priveleges!!

Project goals:
- [x] Make Basic GUI Application that can stop the service or prevent it from launching.
- [ ] Make a tool to help you get admin priveleges (make new account or convert existing).
- [ ] Make a CLI Version or let the program pass with arguments.

I am working on this list from top down, updates soon!
