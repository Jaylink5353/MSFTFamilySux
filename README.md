# Microsoft Family Safety Bypasser!!

For the ones who really need it.

GUI is self-explanatory...

Go to the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/Jaylink5353/MSFTFamilySux/releases/latest) to get a prebuilt exe.

### New! CLI Arguments (v1.2x)
```
Possible Arguments:
--help      Prints this dialogue.
--status    Gets the status of the WpcMon service
--enable    Enables the WpcMon service, so Family Safety runs.
--disable   Disables the WpcMon service, so Family Safety doesn't run
--quiet     Doesn't init window, so you see no feedback 
```

REQUIRES Admin Privileges!! (new tool coming soon)

## Note about "15 Minutes Left" Messages
If your organizer has set up time limits, the "15 Minutes Left" and "2 Minutes Left" Messages may still appear. If the service is NOT running, it should not lock your PC. If it does, please create an issue here. These messages also may quickly pop-up after restarting the computer, this is normal.

Project goals:
- [x] Make Basic GUI Application that can stop the service or prevent it from launching. (v1.x)
- [ ] Make a tool to help you get admin privileges (make new account or convert existing).
- [x] Make a CLI Version or let the program pass with arguments.
